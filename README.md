# symcrt

This package supports the [numerical simulations](https://github.com/Katsevich-Lab/symcrt-manuscript-v1) in the following paper:

Z. Niu, A. Chakraborty, O. Dukes, E. Katsevich.
"Reconciling model-X and doubly robust approaches to conditional independence testing." 
([arXiv]())

It implements the conditional independence testing methodologies compared: the dCRT, the GCM test, and Maxway CRT. It also contains several helper functions used to carry out the numerical simulations.
